				<h3>Jamming to "Fields of Gold" by Sting</h3>
				<p>You'll remember me when the west wind moves<br>
				Upon the fields of barley<br>
				You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
				As we walk in fields of gold </p>
				<p>So she took her love<br>
				For to gaze awhile<br>
				Upon the fields of barley<br>
				In his arms she fell as her hair came down<br>
				Among the fields of gold</p>
				<p>Will you stay with me, will you be my love<br>
				Among the fields of barley<br>
				We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
				As we lie in fields of gold</p>
